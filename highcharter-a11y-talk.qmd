## Highcharts<sup>¬Æ</sup> JS

> Highcharts...is a pure JavaScript charting library based on SVG that makes it easy for developers to create responsive, interactive and accessible charts.

At the time of its first writing, Highcharts' accessibility module didn't seem to be working with the highcharter package.

## Motivating example {.smaller .scrollable}

[Keyboard navigation (accessibility setting) not working #707](https://github.com/jbkunst/highcharter/issues/707)

Now with working keyboard navigation! üéâ

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(highcharter)
data <- data.frame(
    fruit = c("apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"),
    count = c(2, 3, 5, 4)
    )

highchart() %>%
  hc_add_dependency(name = "modules/accessibility.js") %>%
  hc_add_dependency(name = "modules/exporting.js") %>%
  hc_add_dependency(name = "modules/export-data.js") %>%
  hc_title(text = "Fruits") %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = data$fruit) %>%
  hc_add_series(
    data = data$count,
    type = "column",
    name = "Count"
  ) %>%
  hc_exporting(
    enabled = TRUE,
    accessibility = list(
      enabled = TRUE
    )
  ) %>%
    hc_plotOptions(
      accessibility = list(
        enabled = TRUE,
        keyboardNavigation = list(enabled = TRUE)
    )
  )

::: notes
This example, which I got working, came from a GitHub issue in which the user described the expected behavior (working keyboard navigation), and the fact that they weren't able to get it to work with the highcharter package.

**Spoiler alert**: This talk focuses on those lessons learned.

::: notes
This is mainly because the code is already there for you to peruse, and also because (in a shocking twist of fate) demonstrating keyboard navigation features in a slide deck that itself uses the keyboard for navigation is less than ideal.

::: notes
Highcharts is not free for commercial use, and accessibility is a key part of their business model. I'm not gonna get into numbers, but companies spend a lot of time and money to make their products accessible.

I'll focus on the first three features.

## Hidden screen-reader region {visibility="hidden"}

> This second video shows a screen reader navigating to the chart in a webpage, entering the hidden information region for the chart. This is where Ted and the developers added the structure description of chart that could benefit screen reader users, such as the chart type, axis information (automatically generated), and a long description of what is found in the chart (supplied by the chart creator): [Screen reader translating hidden information about chart details](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/video_file/0006/1101597/Line2-top.mp4) [@bert2018].
