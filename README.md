## Source code for R charts

Though the source code for the R charts _is_ in the `.qmd` file in this repo, I recommend looking at it in my [accessible-highcharter repo](https://github.com/batpigandme/accessible-highcharter), where you won't have to surf through my slide notes, etc.

The [accessible-highcharter repo](https://github.com/batpigandme/accessible-highcharter) also has links to the individual blog posts, as well as Rpubs versions of the charts in this presentation (and more).
